abstract = {Simulations of the powder jet in direct metal deposition (DMD) are often made with significant simplifications such as being incompressible, steady-state, or single-component, and do not provide explanation for the choice of parameters in the collision model. This work presents a coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics–Discrete Element Method model for the powder jet in DMD that considers all of the following features: compressibility effects, particle–wall and particle–particle collisions, turbulence, gas mixing, and melt pool boundaries. The goal of the simulation is to optimize the operating conditions and to predict the outcomes of experiments. After effective validation against experimental results, the effects of inlet gas, collision models and different boundary conditions in DMD have been comprehensively studied. It is demonstrated that gases with higher diffusivities, such as helium, are less effective shielding gases than those with lower diffusivities, such as argon. The increased wall temperature arising from the melt pool and track has little influence on the particle distribution.}
