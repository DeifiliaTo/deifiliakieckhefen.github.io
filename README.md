# Hi, I'm Deifilia
I'm currently a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. # URL to site
I have a background in **computational science**, specifically fluid dynamic simulations, with my Master's at ETH ZÃ¼rich. Before that, I did my Bachelor's in Chemical Engineering at McGill University.

## My current interests 
are in distributed computing, to develop general algorithms for parallel machine learning training schemes.

## In the past
I have developed computational fluid dynamic (CFD) solvers using novel techniques such as recurrent CFD, and coupled solid--fluid simulations to predict the deposition of metal particles in metal printing processes.
